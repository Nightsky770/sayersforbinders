Originally published in 1928, these 12 short stories see Lord Peter:
* find missing wills (twice)
* encounter ghosts (possibly)
* babysit his nephew
* solve a crossword puzzle
* find pirate treasure
* face down impostors
* and more!

I have redrafted the crossword puzzle (and its solution) from "The Fascinating Problem of Uncle Meleager's Will", and the map from "The Undignified Melodrama of the Bone of Contention", in Inkscape (files are in source/images) and created both labeled and blank versions. This is my original work, based on Sayers' public domain original, and I place it into the public domain.

CW: Misogyny; antisemetic stereotypes; use of ethnic slurs "gypsy" and "dago" (uncensored); domestic violence; maritial infidelity; blackmail; murder (a couple of which are especially gruesome).

If you are using US letter paper (8.5" x 11"), download the "Letter" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

If you are using A4 paper, download the "A4" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

"Source" directory holds the TeX source files, image files, and other under-the-hood information. You do not need it if you are just printing out for binding; you only need it if you want to make your own custom versions.
