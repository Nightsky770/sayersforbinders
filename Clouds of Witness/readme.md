CW: Misogyny, discussion of capital punishment, domestic abuse, maritial infidelity

Emendations:
* In Chapter 5, I have changed author's "crépe-de-Chine" (acute accent) to "crêpe-de-Chine" (circumflex accent), as that is what the Larousse dictionary has.
* In Chapter 18, I have added a dialogue tag ("Counsel") after the line "After lunch Sir Impey Biggs rose to make his plea for the defense."
