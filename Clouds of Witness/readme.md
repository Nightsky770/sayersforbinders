I have redrafted Sayers' floor plan in Inkscape (files are in source/images).

Emendations:
* In Chapter 5, I have changed author's "crépe-de-Chine" (acute accent) to "crêpe-de-Chine" (circumflex accent), as that is what the Larousse dictionary has.
* In Chapter 18, I have added a dialogue tag ("Counsel") after the line "After lunch Sir Impey Biggs rose to make his plea for the defense."

Fonts used are:
* EB Garamond: https://www.1001freefonts.com/eb-garamond.font
* Deco Caps: https://www.dafont.com/deco-caps.font
* Seaside Resort: https://www.1001fonts.com/seasideresortnf-font.html

For completeness' sake: room labels in the floor plan are in Montserrat Bold (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).
