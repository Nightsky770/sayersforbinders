If you are using US letter (8.5" x 11") paper, download the signature files in the "Letter" folder and print out double-sided, flip on short side.

If you are using A4 paper, download the signature files in the "A4" folder and print out double-sided, flip on short side.

Please note that the letter version has 17 signatures; the A4, only 16.

I have redrafted Sayers' floor plan in Inkscape (files are in source/images) and created both labeled and blank versions of both floors. This is my original work, based on Sayers' public domain original, and I place it into the public domain.

Emendations:
* In Chapter 5, I have changed author's "crépe-de-Chine" (acute accent) to "crêpe-de-Chine" (circumflex accent), as that is what the Larousse dictionary has.
* In Chapter 18, I have added a dialogue tag ("Counsel") after the line "After lunch Sir Impey Biggs rose to make his plea for the defence."

You do not need the source folder unless you are using TeX to generate your own PDF.
