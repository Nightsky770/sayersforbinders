The legendary mystery novels of Dorothy L. Sayers for the DIY bookbinder.
* _Whose Body?_ (originally published 1923) was Sayers' debut novel, and introduced gentleman sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, her most enduring character.
* _Clouds of Witness_ (originally published 1926) chronicles Peter's attempt to defend his brother Gerald, who's accused of murdering their sister's fiance.
* _The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club_ (originally published 1928) sees Peter, himself a WWI vet, untangle a knotty issue at the Bellona Club, a private London club for war veterans.
* _Lord Peter Views The Body_ (originally published 1928) is a collection of 12 short stories.

Please note that I have no plans to do _Unnatural Death_: too many damn n-words. Yes, I am aware that it is from a character Sayers does not particularly like or invite us to sympathize with. Too many n-words. (Also, as a queer person myself, I do not care for the queer-coded villain.) I _do_ plan to do _Strong Poison_, which is due to hit the public domain Jan. 1 2026.

Text and illustrations are in the public domain in the United States.

Fonts used, to the best of my knowledge, are free to use for any purpose including commercial. Whatever original work of mine this effort represents, I place into the public domain. In other words, to the best of my knowledge you _may_ make and sell copies. I am not a lawyer and you are responsible for compliance with your government's copyright laws.

_**I have assumed throughout that you are using borderless printing**._ If your printer adds a border, you will need to make adjustments--the easiest way I've found is to increase BCOR by $borderwidth*2. For my own use (my own printer does not support borderless printing) I also set DIV to an artificially high 15, for smaller margins (since these will be enlarged in printing).

Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
