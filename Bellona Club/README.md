If you are using US letter paper (8.5" x 11"), download the "Letter" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

If you are using A4 paper, download the "A4" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

Please note that the A4 has 1 signature fewer than the letter version.

"Source" directory holds the TeX source files, image files, and other under-the-hood information. You do not need it if you are just printing out for binding; you only need it if you want to make your own custom versions.
